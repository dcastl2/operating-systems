Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
=========================

IRC is an chat protocol developed in 1988. IRC chat rooms used to be quite
active in the early 90s among kernel hackers and computer enthusiasts before
being adopted into the mainstream by casual users. Its popularity declined in
the 2000s on account of the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook
and Twitter. 

However, to this day, no platform has truly replaced the IRC chat room. 

To enable you to chat with each other about assignments and tests for this
class, I have installed an IRC server for you to chat in.  You may find me
there as well.


IRC on the Server
=================

How to join a chat room in IRC:

  0. First, you will want to connect to ``steam.cct.lsu.edu`` in a separate
  terminal which is dedicated to IRC use, because you cannot execute other
  commands while your IRC client is running. 

  1. If you are logged in to ``steam.cct.lsu.edu``, you may type ``irc`` to
  open the command-line client to connect to the local IRC server.

  2. Type ``/join #csc4103`` to join the CSC 4103 chat room.

  3. You may type in text to chat with your classmates.

  4. Type ``/quit`` to quit the IRC client and return to the command
  interpreter. 

You are free to learn about other IRC commands and use them.
